2/ Using your experience with building public-facing responsive web applications, suggest improvements of the Contact Form component

Technical:
Website seems to be caching issues when using the site in non-incopneto mode on any browser.
Perhapse implementing a a cach-buster code feature on the site would help to prevent this.

Issue:
When using the site on a WIndows desktop, the JS in the console seems to incorrecrtly report the site as being on a mobile platorm before correcting to false

Issue:
Various errors on the javascript when on the contact form eg: 
contact-us:1 Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://develop.somo.us/icons/icon-144x144.png?v=04168d73fcb8ffd549f239ad265b973a (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)

Issue:Resources are blocking the Contus-UIs page from loading faster
Solution:Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles

Issue: Some assets on the oage were rendereded/loaded inefficiently due to thier cache policy
Suggestion: Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy, as a A longer cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page

Issue: Some fonts werew not visible during page loads eg: (7cHqv4kjgoGqM7E30-8s51ostz0rdg.woff2)
Suggestion: USe the 'font-display' CSS feature to ensure text is user-visible while webfonts are loading

Issue: for screen readers the <html> element does not have a [lang] attribute
