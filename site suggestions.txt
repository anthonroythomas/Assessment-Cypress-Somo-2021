2/ Using your experience with building public-facing responsive web applications, suggest improvements of the Contact Form component

Technical:

Website seems to hit a rate limit on the server, responding with 503 error.
Perhapse increasing the rate limit, or max connection limit would improve this.

Issue:
When using the site on a Windows desktop, the JS in the console seems to incorrecrtly report the site as being on a mobile platform before correcting to mobile = false
Maybe a race condition, or just simply a bug tjat needs fixing

Issue:
Various js errors in the browser console when on the contact form, eg: 
contact-us:1 Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://develop.somo.us/icons/icon-144x144.png?v=04168d73fcb8ffd549f239ad265b973a (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)

Issue:
Resources are blocking the Contact-Us page from loading faster
Solution:Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles

Issue: Some assets on the page were rendereded/loaded in-efficiently due to thier cache policy
Suggestion: Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy, as a A longer cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page

Issue: Some fonts were not visible during page loads eg: (7cHqv4kjgoGqM7E30-8s51ostz0rdg.woff2)
Suggestion: USe the 'font-display' CSS feature to ensure text is user-visible while webfonts are loading

Issue: for screen readers the <html> element does not have a [lang] attribute
